# Driver: San Francisco Multiplayer
[Here](https://github.com/Scholette/DSF_MP_Expansion/releases) you can download the latest modded multiplayer files for Driver: San Francisco

# Disclaimer
This mod breaks the Single Player part of the game, because currently we can't 100% decomplie the fchunk files, so it causes unwanted side effects like infinite loading while wanting to start Single Player, but Multiplayer works just fine. Please keep this in mind while using the mod.

# Content:
- New and unique Race events (Sprint GP/Classic Race)
- New Takedown events
- New Trailblazer events
- New Qualifying game modes(Fiat Hunt/Anti-Highway Rush and so on)

# Contribution:
If you feel like you want to see something new in Multiplayer, then [let me know](https://github.com/Scholette/DSF_MP_Expansion/issues) and I'll look into it if it's possible with the current tools and boundaries.
